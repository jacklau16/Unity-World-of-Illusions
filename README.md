# CSMVR16-Coursework-2

This coursework aims to build a virtual world that illustrates the concept of "World of Illusions".

This world aims to create a series of illusions that the user can navigate through. It is a world that seems normal. Yet with a closer glance, and puzzling, players will notice a world filled with illusions, fake reality.

The virtual world is developed by `Unity`.
